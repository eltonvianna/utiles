# Summary

This is my implementation of some Java utilities.

## The back end development

To implement the back end I've decided to use only the Java 8 API, except the import of some test libraries, such JUnit, Mockito, etc, that are required to create and perform unit tests.
## Tdd aproach

The TDD approach was applied using JUnit as way to cover the unit tests.

## Prerequisites

Installation of **Java 8** and **Maven 3**. Add **JAVA_HOME/jre/bin** and **M2_HOME/bin** to the **PATH** environment variable. Also is required access to the internet as way to access the Maven Central repository.

## Getting Started

After cloned this project, change to **utiles** directory and run the command: **mvn clean install**. This command will perform the build, run the tests and packaging.

### Unexpected errors

You can open the log file to see more details about unexpected errors in the server side.
